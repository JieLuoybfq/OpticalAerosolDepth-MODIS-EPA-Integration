# OpticalAerosolDepth-MODIS-EPA-Integration
An ongoing project at Michigan Technological University (MODIS NASA Terraâ€™s Satellite data and EPA Ground station data integration using Python) with Dr. Benjamin W. Ong (Director of Data Science program at MTU) along with Dr. Xin Xi to generate a standard dataset for UCI Machine Learning repository of optical aerosol readings from satellite image granules and EPA ground station readings and also to build predictive models of aerosol optical depth.
